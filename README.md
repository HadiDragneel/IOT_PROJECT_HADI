# IOT_PROJECT_HADI
The explanation and code of my PIR Motion Sensor Security IoT project

* The Python file contains the code I used to make everything happen on the Raspberry Pi 3B+.
* The explanation document explains my thought process, goal, reasoning and results.
* The images depict a simple example of it working when opened in order.
* The Thingspeak link is for a public channel where the data recorded from the sensor is stored.
